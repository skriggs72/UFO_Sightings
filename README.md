# javascript-challenge
This is the personal project for unit 14(Intro-To_javascript).
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the UFO sighting, with the dataset provided by the instructor.

The tools used in buliding this app: D3.js, Bootstrap, jQuery.js.
Usage of the app
Playing on the link to the app: choose and input a data from the list of possible dates on the left side of the page. On clicking the "Button", a table will be created for UFO sightings for that given date. 
To play the app locally, clone the repo and open the index.html. Yes, it's just that simple!!
